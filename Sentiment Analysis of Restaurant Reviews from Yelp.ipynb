Tables were sticky and uncleaned, observed that other tables vacated were not cleaned. Staff totally disregarded those of us who were over 55 and/or had children but were very busy serving everyone else. Very disappointing since this was one of the first restaurants we visited since the beginning of COVID. Food OK. Service TERRIBLE. WON'T BE COMING BACK.  Note that we came on Sat. Aug. 21st @ 2pm with reservations to enjoy Happy Hour and staff seemed put out that we weren't ordering more. Our bill was $140ish not including tax. Hope they read this.\"])"

I do have to agree for the most part.  We got seated and took forever for someone to bring us water.  We saw so many staffs walking around.  But it just doesn't feel a lot of them did so with a purpose.  When we did flag someone down, she was quite pleasant and took our orders.  My wife got the half BBQ rack which she complained that the portion was tiny and cold.  We commented this to the waitress and they apologized on behalf of kitchen and offered for the same or something else.  It was good that the manager came by afterwards and asked us for details and was very gracious.  My wife then got curry shrimp over rice as replacement.  That was decent.  Nothing to boast about.  I had the mushroom cheddar burger.  I have to say it was quite delicious and cooked to perfection.  My only complaint is that it surely doesn't look like the same pic as other people had posted in the past.  Please take a look at my photo and be the judge.  My son got the MAc and cheese and gave it so so review.  He didn't even finish...so that's telling.  All in all, they have to definitely improve on.  I will not go back for sure.  Free wifi.\"])"
